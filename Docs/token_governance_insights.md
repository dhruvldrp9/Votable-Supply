**2. Methodology Documentation:**



a. **Key Considerations:**
- VS and attack cost: The cost of attack is inversely proportional to the VS. A higher VS would mean a higher cost of attack, thereby making it more secure.
- PR impact: The PR gauge the level of VS engagement. A higher PR would imply more participation, leading to a higher VS, thereby increasing the security and cost of attack.
- Total Supply's influence: A larger total supply increases the value and utilization of the token, affecting the PR and thus the VS. Higher the total supply, more beneficial it is for maximizing the cost of attack.



b. **Calculation Method:**
- Correlation function between PR and VS: Considering the past data, the PR and VS relationship appears inverse. Lower PRs have corresponded with higher VSs, illuminating an intriguing inverse relationship.
- Prediction equation: I have used a time series model to predict the future values of VS. It incorporates an auto-regressive process to estimate the future VS based on its past values.
- Determining growth rate: I have calculated the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from the given data and then applied this growth rate to find the future values of VS. This seems reasonable since the VS shows a fairly stable rising trend that can be well-described by a constant annual growth rate.
