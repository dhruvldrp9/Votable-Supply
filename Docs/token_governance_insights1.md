Part 1:

Starting with the provided "optimal_vs_mean" as the base for month 1, and assuming a 2% monthly increase in the optimal votable supply (as a reasonable estimate based on potential growth of the token community and general token economic inflation), the predicted ideal votable supply (VS) for the next 24 months would be as follows:

| Month | Predicted VS    |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1     | 93673836.20     |
| 2     | 95543273.12     |

(Note: The calculation for each successive month is done by multiplying the previous month's VS by 1.02 (for 2% increase)).

Part 2:

The suggested logic for predicting the ideal VS is based on the token governance principle that as the community grows and as inflation takes effect in the token economy, the total supply of votable tokens should naturally increase. We assume a modest monthly growth rate of 2%, which we apply to the mean optimal VS value provided. This accounts for growth stress during the prediction period and provides a reasonable forecast for the increasing cost resistance of the system.

Several assumptions have been made in this process:
- The growth of the community and token economy remains relatively steady throughout the considered time frame.
- The 2% growth rate is a reasonable estimate; reality might necessitate adjusting this figure.
- Other token market factors, such as liquidity, demand, and utility, remain largely unchanged.

Please note that this is a simple, linear growth projection. More complex growth models could consider the potential for exponential growth, possible market saturation, variations in token utility changes, and more.
