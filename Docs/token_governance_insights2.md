Based on the provided data and our understanding of token economics, I will consider the Correlation Matrix, Optimal VS, and Attack Cost Model to predict the ideal Votable Supply month-wise for the next 12 months (Dec/24 - Dec/25).

Considering the current correlation matrix, we notice that CS(Circulating Supply) and VS(Votable Supply) have a high correlation of 0.8703593884175247, which indicates that VS increases as CS increases. Therefore, as we move into the new year, we can expect a continued increase in the VS, assuming the CS continues to expand.

1. Predicted value of the ideal Votable Supply month-wise for(Dec/24 - Dec/25) next 12 months:

Please note that these are projected values based on the trend observed in the historical data. Here is the predicted Votable Supply for the next twelve months:

| Month-year | Predicted Votable Supply                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Dec-24     | 105422675.92 (using optimal_vs_mean as baseline) |
| Jan-25     | 106532525.62 (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| Feb-25     | 107547208.37 (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| Mar-25     | 108572923.65  (assuming a 1% increase)          |
| Apr-25     | 109609892.09  (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| May-25     | 110658280.01  (assuming a 1% increase)        |
| Jun-25     | 111718152.41  (assuming a 1% increase)          |
| Jul-25     | 112789573.93  (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| Aug-25     | 113872609.07 (assuming a 1% increase)          |
| Sep-25     | 114967322.16  (assuming a 1% increase)        |
| Oct-25     | 116073777.38  (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| Nov-25     | 117192039.76  (assuming a 1% increase)         |
| Dec-25     | 118322174.15  (assuming a 1% increase)        |

2. Detailed logic used for predicting the ideal VS for the next 12 months:

The predicted ideal votable supply was calculated based on an assumed steady percentage increase of 1% per month from the baseline (Dec 2024), determined by optimal_vs_mean. This percentage was chosen to reflect a general upward trend, given the high correlation between CS and VS noted in the correlation matrix. However, it's worth pointing out that the specific percentage can be fine-tuned based on more comprehensive prediction models or additional information.

On a go-forward basis, it's critical to take into consideration market conditions, protocol changes, and participant behavior and regularly evaluate these assumptions. For a more accurate projection, a combination of historical data analysis and predictive modeling techniques, such as time-series forecasting or machine learning algorithms, could be employed. These more nuanced models could account for other predictors and complex interrelationships beyond the high correlation between CS and VS alone. 

Keeping in mind that this is a simplification and actual results may vary as they might be significantly influenced by business developments, market volatility, regulatory factors, or other aspects not factored into this prediction.
