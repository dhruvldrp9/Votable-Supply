2. Methodology Documentation:

a. Key Considerations:
-  VS (Votable Supply) and attack cost have a direct relationship. As the votable supply increases, the attack cost also increases - discouraging unwanted malicious activities.
-  PR (Participation Ratio) represents the percentage of coins involved in the voting process and indicates a higher level of network consensus. A higher PR suggests a more secured network, making it expensive for an attack.
-  Total supply plays a significant role in determining network security, as a larger total supply would require a larger number of tokens to carry out an attack successfully, therefore increasing the attack cost.

b. Calculation Method:
-  A direct correlation between PR and VS is established from historic data suggesting that as the participation ratio increases, so does the votable supply. This correlation is calculated using a linear regression model using past monthly data.
-  The VS for upcoming months is predicted by calculating the common difference in the historical monthly VS data assuming a linear growth and adding this common difference to the VS of the immediate preceding month. The linear growth assumption is made based on visible trends in the historical data.
-  The growth rate between months is calculated as the change in VS between consecutive months divided by the VS of the initial month. This growth rate is calculated for each consecutive month, and a mean growth rate is determined and used for predictions. 

The attack cost is directly proportional to the votable supply and the participation ratio. Hence, maximizing these metrics will help increase the cost of conducting an attack, thereby enhancing security.
