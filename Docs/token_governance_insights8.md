2. Methodology Documentation:

a. Key Considerations:

The relationship between VS (Votable Supply) and attack cost: The cost of an attack increases as the size of the votable supply increases. When more tokens are votable, it becomes more costly to acquire enough tokens to launch an attack, making the network more secure. 

PR (Participation Ratio) Impact: High participation ratio leads to a highly secure network as it would require a higher amount of tokens to perform an attack, and hence, the cost of an attack would increase substantially. 

Total Supply's influence: As the total supply of tokens increases, the ideal votable supply would also increase preventing attacks by economically disincentivizing malicious actors.

b. Calculation Method:

Correlation function: The correlation coefficient indicates a relatively strong positive correlation between total supply (CS) and votable supply (VS). Therefore, as the total supply increases, we would also expect a similar increase in VS. It logically supports the need for an increased votable supply as the total supply of tokens increases.

Prediction Equation: The growth rate was determined by finding the percentage increase in VS from December 2024 to November 2024. This approach was used as the VS increased steadily from these months in the past making it a viable, predictable pattern. 

This percentage growth was then compounded month over month in the predictions to derive the ideal votable supply from December 2024 through December 2025. Therefore: 

VS_{t+1} = VS_t * (1 + growth_rate)

Growth rate between months: The growth rate was calculated as (new value - old value) / old value, where the new and old values are the votable supplies of two consecutive months (Nov 2024 - Dec 2024). Using this growth rate, it's assumed the votable supply will grow at this rate for each month over the next year.
