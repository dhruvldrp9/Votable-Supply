Predicting the parameters beyond November 2024 involves projecting trends from the historical data and setting parameter values to maximize the cost of an attack. I analyzed the correlations between parameters to understand their relationships and inform the predictions. Growth rates were chosen to maintain trend continuity and realism.

The participation ratio (PR), VPI, and LAR show regular growth, reflecting an active ecosystem and increasing effective participation in governance. These help raise the attack resistance score, if the votable supply (VS) keeps pace, which it does in the above predictions. Actual VPI and community score (CS) grow in line with the previous trends keeping the token supply dynamics healthy, in line with an expanding ecosystem.

2. Calculation Methodology:

a. Parameter Relationships:
The VS is tied positively with PR, VPI, and Actual VPI.
The VS negatively affects PSI and LAR. High VS could decrease the PSI and increase LAR, whereas low LAR or high PSI supports a higher VS.
The correlation between VPI and VS is strong (0.5099), dictating a positive relationship between increasing voting power and the network's available votable supply. 

b. Trend Continuity:
Growth rates used are:
PR: 0.25% monthly,
PSI: 0.38% monthly,
VPI: 0.94% monthly,
LAR: -0.63% monthly,
Actual VPI: -5.26% monthly,
VS: 0.66% monthly.

The above growth rates were chosen to ensure the trend from Nov 2024 continues logically into Dec 2024 and beyond. The aggregate participation impacts are incorporated into the new PSI, VPI, and LAR forecasts.

3. Attack Cost Analysis:
There are several ways the predictions maximize the attack cost, related to the participatory nature of the governance and the size of the votable supply. Increasing PR and VPI improves the participation in the token governance, raising the cost of influencing voting via attacks. High LAR can discourage attacks by signaling that the level of active participation in the network will be sufficient to resist attack attempts. VS growth is kept at the pace of token economy expansion thereby maintaining a healthy participative community. By retaining strong VPI gains and controlling LAR declines, we maximize attack costs and strengthen protocol security. The aggregate attack resistance score is projected to increase from 0.9929 to 0.9936 over the forecast period.
