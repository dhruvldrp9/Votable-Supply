2. Calculations Methodology:

a. Parameter relationships: 
- PR: A higher participation ratio leads to more tokens being votable, thus the votable supply increases (VS = CS * PR). 
- PSI: It doesn't have a direct impact on VS but affects the voting power influence and thus the resistance to attack.
- VPI: It directly impacts the maximum cost to affect a meaningful proportion of the system, and thus impacts the attack cost.
- LAR: It's directly proportional to token security and inversely proportional to the attack cost.
- The formula for VPI is `VPI = (VS/CS)^(PR + PSI) + LAR`

b. Trend continuity: The trends were maintained by considering the month-over-month growth rates and standard deviations from the previous periods. The growth rates were maintained similar to the previous periods for realistic continuity. Unusual jumps in the trend were avoided.

3. Attack Cost Analysis:
- Attack resistance increases with increased participant engagement i.e, increasing PR and hence the votable supply. 
- The resistance to attack is quantified as `resistance_score = 1/ (1+ e^(PSI – VPI – LAR))`. In Dec 2025, we maintain our resistance score above 0.99 indicating the high security of the token.
- The consistent increase in Votable supply (VS) while maintaining realistic PR improves overall security.
- VS has a compound-monthly growth rate of 1.24% and this continuous growth positively impacts the attack cost, making system attacks costlier over time.
