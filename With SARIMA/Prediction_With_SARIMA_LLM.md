2. Methodology Documentation:

The Predicted VS values were calculated using a combination of factors represented by the provided metrics. The PR, VPI, and Actual VPI were treated as direct contributors to the VS. Higher values of these metrics result in higher VS, which in turn maximizes the cost of an attack. The PSI and LAR metrics have an inverse relationship with the VS as higher staking or liquidity generally indicates that less tokens are available for voting. 

A steady growth pattern over the course of the year was implemented in the predictions. This incorporates an assumption of increasing participation and token distribution, contributing to overall system security. 

3. Security Analysis:

By deliberately maximizing the VS, the cost to an attacker wishing to manipulate or seize control of the protocol is also maximized. An attacker would need to acquire a significant portion of the token supply in a governance attack, with the cost of acquiring this fraction of the total token supply being directly proportional to VS.

Potential attack vectors revolve heavily around acquiring control of a significant portion of the votable tokens. This could come in the form of Sybil attacks, where an attacker controls many different identities and amasses power through this perceived decentralization.

With our predictions, the cost of a Sybil attack significantly increases due to the requirement of controlling many tokens associated with various voting identities. The increased VS also increases resistance to 'whale' attacks where an individual or colluding group of large token holders wish to manipulate the protocol outcome.  

By continuously raising the VS on a month-by-month basis, we effectively raise the cost of attacking the system over time, gradually making the system more secure.
