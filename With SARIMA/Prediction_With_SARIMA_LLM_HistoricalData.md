2. Methodology Documentation:
We used a consistent 1.1% month-on-month growth rate from the `Actual_VPI`, using November 2024 a base month, which is in line with the mean historical growth rate. The increase in the Votable Supply (VS) makes it more expensive for attackers to gain enough votes to influence the governance system, thus making the system more secure and raising the cost of an attack. 

Key metrics considered include Protocol Staking Index (PSI), Participation Ratio (PR), Voting Power Index (VPI), and Liquidity Availability Ratio (LAR). We assumed that the value of these metrics remains steady or increases due to a rise in the votable supply. This steady increase aims to maintain the balance and fairness of the voting power, thereby promoting robust and decentralized governance.

3. Security Analysis:
The predicted VS values are set to enhance system security by making it cost-prohibitive for an attacker to acquire enough voting power to manipulate the system. As the VS increases, the cost for an attacker to acquire 51% of the votes increases, which makes the network more secure.

Potential attack vectors include an attacker acquiring a large amount of tokens to influence votes maliciously or a Sybil attack where an attacker creates multiple accounts to gain a disproportionately large influence. By increasing the VS, the cost of such attacks becomes prohibitively high, thus deterring potential attackers.

In terms of quantifying the improvement in security metrics, given that our predictions follow an increasing trend throughout the year, the cost for an attacker to influence votes rises by roughly 1.1% per month. Over 12 months, this leads to a significant increase in the attack cost and thus a correspondingly significant improvement in the security of the system.
